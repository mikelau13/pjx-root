To spin up containers
```bash
devcontainers@AWMD-48MYC44:/mnt/f/repos/pjx/pjx-root$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.devcontainer.yml up -d
```

## Next Steps (Optional Runtime Fixes):
The Docker Compose build process is now working correctly. The remaining issues are runtime compatibility problems that don't prevent the containers from starting, but may affect functionality:

pjx-api-dotnet: Needs proper working directory or project specification
pjx-web-react: Node.js 18 OpenSSL compatibility issue (common with older React apps)
pjx-api-node: Restify library compatibility with Node.js 18
These are separate issues from the original Docker Compose build failures and can be addressed individually if needed.
