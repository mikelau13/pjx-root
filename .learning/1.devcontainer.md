Converted the pjx-root solution and all its 5 components to work with WSL devcontainer. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary of Changes

1. Main Root Configuration

- .devcontainer/devcontainer.json: Master devcontainer configuration with multi-service support
- docker-compose.devcontainer.yml: Development-specific compose file with optimized settings
- .devcontainer/setup.sh: Automated setup script for development environment


2. Individual Service Configurations

Each of the 5 components now has:
- Dockerfile.dev: Development-optimized Docker images with hot reload
- .devcontainer/devcontainer.json: Service-specific devcontainer configuration

Services configured:
- pjx-web-react (Port 3000): React app with hot reload
- pjx-api-node (Port 8081): Node.js API with nodemon
- pjx-graphql-apollo (Port 4000): GraphQL server with hot reload
- pjx-api-dotnet (Port 6001): .NET Core API with dotnet watch
- pjx-sso-identityserver (Ports 5001/5002): Identity Server with SSL

3. Development Features

- Hot reload enabled for all services
- Port forwarding automatically configured
- VS Code extensions pre-installed for each technology stack
- Debugging support for Node.js and .NET services
- Shared Docker network for inter-service communication

4. Documentation

- Updated README.md: Added WSL devcontainer instructions
- DEVELOPMENT.md: Comprehensive development guide
- Updated .gitignore: Added devcontainer-specific ignores


5. Usage Options

*Option 1 - Multi-service development (recommended):*
Open root folder in VS Code
`code .`
Reopen in Container when prompted
Start all services: docker-compose -f docker-compose.devcontainer.yml up

*Option 2 - Individual service development:*
Navigate to any service folder
`cd projects/pjx-web-react`
`code .`
Reopen in Container for focused development

The setup provides a complete WSL devcontainer environment with:
- ✅ Full IDE support with IntelliSense
- ✅ Debugging capabilities
- ✅ Hot reload for all services
- ✅ Consistent development environment
- ✅ Pre-configured extensions and settings
- ✅ Network communication between services
- ✅ Individual and multi-service development workflows
