Make sure config the ip address in hosts file for the following domains (get the ip address from minikube ip):
  api.pjx.com
  www.pjx.com
  ql.pjx.com
  pjx-sso-identityserver

The application still have a lot of issues to be fixed, for example, Register not working because of CORS; Sign On still need to configure the Identity Server URL.

To start application, open in web browser:

http://api.pjx.com/api/calendar/healthcheck
http://www.pjx.com:30100/
